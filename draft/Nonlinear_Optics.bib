  abstract = {We study the low-frequency properties of the bulk photovoltaic effect in topological semimetals. The bulk photovoltaic effect is a nonlinear optical effect that generates dc photocurrents under uniform irradiation, which is allowed by noncentrosymmetry. It is a promising mechanism for a terahertz photodetection based on topological semimetals. Here, we systematically investigate the low-frequency behavior of the second-order optical conductivity in point-node semimetals. Through symmetry and power-counting analysis, we show that Dirac and Weyl points with tilted cones show the leading low-frequency divergence. In particular, we find new divergent behaviors of the conductivity of Dirac and Weyl points under circularly polarized light, where the conductivity scales as ùúî‚àí2 and ùúî‚àí1 near the gap-closing point in two and three dimensions, respectively. We provide a further perspective on the low-frequency bulk photovoltaic effect by revealing the complete quantum geometric meaning of the second-order optical conductivity tensor. The bulk photovoltaic effect has two origins, which are the transition of electron position and the transition of electron velocity during the optical excitation, and the resulting photocurrents are, respectively, called the shift current and the injection current. Based on an analysis of two-band models, we show that the injection current is controlled by the quantum metric and Berry curvature, whereas the shift current is governed by the Christoffel symbols near the gap-closing points in semimetals. Finally, for further demonstrations of our theory beyond simple two-band models, we perform first-principles calculations on the shift and injection photocurrent conductivities as well as geometric quantities of antiferromagnetic MnGeO3 and ferromagnetic PrGeAl, respectively, as representatives of real magnetic Dirac and Weyl semimetals. Our calculations reveal gigantic peaks in many nonvanishing elements of photoconductivity tensors below a photon energy of about 0.2 eV in both MnGeO3 and PrGeAl. In particular, we show the ùúî‚àí1 enhancement of the shift conductivity tensors due to the divergent behavior of the geometric quantities near the Dirac and Weyl points as well as slightly gapped topological nodes. Moreover, the low-frequency bulk photovoltaic effect is tunable by carrier doping and magnetization orientation rotation. Our work brings new insights into the structure of nonlinear optical responses as well as the design of semimetal-based terahertz photodetectors.},

  abstract = {While the basic principles and limitations of conventional solar cells are well understood, relatively little attention has gone toward maximizing the potential efficiency of photovoltaic devices based on shift currents. In this work, we outline simple design principles for the optimization of shift currents for frequencies near the band gap, derived from the analysis of a general effective model. The use of a novel sum rule allows us to express the band edge shift current in terms of a few model parameters and to show it depends explicitly on wavefunctions via Berry connections in addition to standard band structure. We use our approach to identify two new classes of shift current photovoltaics, ferroelectric polymer films and single-layer orthorhombic monochalcogenides such as GeS. We introduce tight-binding models for these systems, and show that they exhibit the largest shift current responsivities at the band edge reported so far. Moreover, exploring the parameter space of these models we find photoresponsivities that can exceed \$100\$ mA/W. Our results show how the study of the shift current via effective models allows one to improve the possible efficiency of devices based on this mechanism and better grasp their potential to compete with conventional solar cells.},

  abstract = {The circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) is the part of a photocurrent that switches depending on the sense of circular polarization of the incident light. It has been consistently observed in systems without inversion symmetry and depends on non-universal material details. Here we find that in a class of Weyl semimetals (for example, SrSi2) and three-dimensional Rashba materials (for example, doped Te) without inversion and mirror symmetries, the injection contribution to the CPGE trace is effectively quantized in terms of the fundamental constants e, h, c and with no material-dependent parameters. This is so because the CPGE directly measures the topological charge of Weyl points, and non-quantized corrections from disorder and additional bands can be small over a significant range of incident frequencies. Moreover, the magnitude of the CPGE induced by a Weyl node is relatively large, which enables the direct detection of the monopole charge with current techniques.},

We show that non-vanishing valley polarizations in twisted graphene systems would give rise to the anomalous Hall effect, which can be tuned by in-plane magnetic fields. The valley polarized states are also associated with giant Faraday and Kerr rotations in the terahertz frequency regime. Moreover, we propose that the twisted graphene systems exhibit colossal nonlinear optical responses by virtue of the inversion-symmetry breaking, the small bandwidth, and the small excitation gaps of the systems. In twisted double bilayer graphene, we find that certain components of the nonlinear photo-conductivity tensor are directly proportional to the orbital magnetization of the system, which would exhibit remarkable hysteresis behavior in response to perpendicular magnetic fields.},

  abstract = {Excitons are fundamental quasiparticles that are ubiquitous in photoexcited semiconductors and insulators. Despite causing a sharp and strong photoabsorption near the interband absorption edge, charge-neutral excitons do not yield photocurrent in conventional photovoltaic processes unless dissociated into free charge carriers. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that excitons can directly contribute to photocurrent generation through a nonlinear light‚àímatter interaction in a noncentrosymmetric semiconductor CuI. Epitaxial thin films of CuI exhibit a substantial enhancement of photocurrent at exciton resonance energies even below the bandgap. From the light polarization dependence, this photocurrent is identified to be shift current, a nonlinear photocurrent driven by the change in the geometric Berry phase of electron wave functions upon the optical transition. The shift current at the exciton resonance is much larger than that induced above the band gap by free electron‚àíhole excitation, and their signs are opposite. First-principles calculations elucidate that the sign and magnitude of the exciton shift current are strongly dependent on the strain in the thin film. The present study reveals the crucial role of excitons in enhancing the shift current magnitude and its strain sensitivity, and will open an unprecedented route for efficient manipulation of nonlinear optical effects.},
