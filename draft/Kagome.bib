  abstract = {Topological insulators and their intriguing edge states can be understood in a single-particle picture and can as such be exhaustively classified. Interactions significantly complicate this picture and can lead to entirely new insulating phases, with an altogether much richer and less explored phenomenology. Most saliently, lattice generalizations of fractional quantum Hall states, dubbed fractional Chern insulators, have recently been predicted to be stabilized by interactions within nearly dispersionless bands with nonzero Chern number, C. Contrary to their continuum analogues, these states do not require an external magnetic field and may potentially persist even at room temperature, which make these systems very attractive for possible applications such as topological quantum computation. This review recapitulates the basics of tight-binding models hosting nearly flat bands with nontrivial topology, C{$\neq$}0, and summarizes the present understanding of interactions and strongly correlated phases within these bands. Emphasis is made on microscopic models, highlighting the analogy with continuum Landau level physics, as well as qualitatively new, lattice specific, aspects including Berry curvature fluctuations, competing instabilities as well as novel collective states of matter emerging in bands with {\textbar}C{\textbar}{$>$}1. Possible experimental realizations, including oxide interfaces and cold atom implementations as well as generalizations to flat bands characterized by other topological invariants are also discussed.},

  abstract = {In the last years, kagome materials received massive attention by virtue of being candidate hosts for a large variety of quantum phases: spin liquids, unconventional superconductivity, and topological phases of matter, to name the more exotic. One of the most interesting features is tunability: changing the filling, the non-interacting band structure can be tuned from flat bands to conventional metallic phases as well as to semimetals. In this paper we concentrate on the latter. At specific lattice filling the electronic bands have a semimetallic structure, hosting Dirac, massless quasiparticles, like in graphene or other layered two dimensional materials. Specifically, we determine what terms can be added to the nearest neighbor hopping that open at gap at said Dirac point. These terms can in principle arise through external perturbations, interactions or collective instabilities. We classify the sixteen possible gap-opening terms according to the broken symmetries. Furthermore, we identify concrete microscopic realisations allowing for an interpretation of these phases.},

  abstract = {Itinerant electrons in a two-dimensional kagome lattice form a Dirac semimetal, similar to graphene. When lattice and spin symmetries are broken by various periodic perturbations this semimetal is shown to spawn interesting nonmagnetic insulating phases. These include a two-dimensional topological insulator with a nontrivial Z2 invariant and robust gapless edge states, as well as dimerized and trimerized ``Kekul{\'e}'' insulators. The latter two are topologically trivial but the Kekul{\'e} phase possesses a complex order parameter with fractionally charged vortex excitations. A charge-density wave is shown to couple to the Dirac fermions as an effective axial gauge field.},

  abstract = {The kagome lattice has garnered significant attention due to its ability to host quantum spin Fermi liquid states. Recently, the combination of unique lattice geometry, electron-electron correlations, and adjustable magnetism in solid kagome materials has led to the discovery of numerous fascinating quantum properties. These include unconventional superconductivity, charge and spin density waves (CDW/SDW), pair density waves (PDW), and Chern insulator phases. These emergent states are closely associated with the distinctive characteristics of the kagome lattice's electronic structure, such as van Hove singularities, Dirac fermions, and flat bands, which can exhibit exotic quasi-particle excitations under different symmetries and magnetic conditions. Recently, various quantum kagome materials have been developed, typically consisting of kagome layers stacked along the \$z\$-axis with atoms either filling the geometric centers of the kagome lattice or embedded between the layers. In this topical review, we begin by introducing the fundamental properties of several kagome materials. To gain an in-depth understanding of the relationship between topology and correlation, we then discuss the complex phenomena observed in these systems. These include the simplest kagome metal \$T\_3X\$, kagome intercalation metal \$TX\$, and the ternary compounds \$AT\_6X\_6\$ and \$RT\_3X\_5\$ (\$A\$ = Li, Mg, Ca, or rare earth; \$T\$ = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni; \$X\$ = Sn, Ge; \$R\$ = K, Rb, Cs). Finally, we provide a perspective on future experimental work in this field.},

  abstract = {Motivated by the growing interest in band structures featuring higher-order Van Hove singularities (HOVHS), we investigate a spinless fermion kagome system characterized by nearest-neighbor (NN) and next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping amplitudes. While NN hopping preserves time-reversal symmetry, NNN hopping, akin to chiral hopping on the Haldane lattice, breaks time-reversal symmetry and leads to the formation of topological bands with Chern numbers ranging from \$C = {\textbackslash}pm 1\$ to \$C = {\textbackslash}pm 4\$. We perform analytical and numerical analysis of the energy bands near the high-symmetry points \${\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{{\textbackslash}Gamma\}\$, \${\textbackslash}pm {\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{K\}\$, and \${\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{M\_i\}\$ (\$i=1,2,3\$), which uncover a rich and complex landscape of HOVHS, controlled by the magnitude and phase of the NNN hopping. We observe power-law divergences in the density of states (DOS), \${\textbackslash}rho({\textbackslash}epsilon) {\textbackslash}sim {\textbar}{\textbackslash}epsilon{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}\{-{\textbackslash}nu\}\$, with exponents \${\textbackslash}nu = 1/2, 1/3, 1/4\$, which can significantly affect the anomalous Hall response at low temperatures when the Fermi level crosses the HOVHS. Additionally, the NNN hopping induces the formation of higher Chern number bands \$C = {\textbackslash}pm 2, {\textbackslash}pm 4\$ in the middle of the spectrum obeying a sublattice interference whereupon electronic states are maximally localized in each of the sublattices when the momentum approaches the three high-symmetry points \${\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{M\_i\}\$ (\$i=1,2,3\$) on the Brillouin zone boundary. This classification of HOVHS in kagome systems provides a platform to explore unconventional electronic orders induced by electronic correlations.},
