  abstract = {Corner-dwelling topological states                            Computing the electric polarization of a crystal is surprisingly tricky, but it can be tackled with the help of a topological concept, the so-called Berry phase. Extensions to higher multiple moments, such as quadrupole and octupole, are even trickier. Benalcazar               et al.               built a theoretical framework for dealing with these moments in certain types of solids. In the presence of some crystalline symmetries, the quadrupole moment is quantized, and the corners of the system play host to fractionally charged, topologically protected states. These predictions may be testable in cold atom and photonic systems.                                         Science               , this issue p.               61                        ,              Some crystalline symmetries can quantize the electric quadrupole and octupole moments of a solid.           ,              The Berry phase provides a modern formulation of electric polarization in crystals. We extend this concept to higher electric multipole moments and determine the necessary conditions and minimal models for which the quadrupole and octupole moments are topologically quantized electromagnetic observables. Such systems exhibit gapped boundaries that are themselves lower-dimensional topological phases. Furthermore, they host topologically protected corner states carrying fractional charge, exhibiting fractionalization at the boundary of the boundary. To characterize these insulating phases of matter, we introduce a paradigm in which ``nested'' Wilson loops give rise to topological invariants that have been overlooked. We propose three realistic experimental implementations of this topological behavior that can be immediately tested. Our work opens a venue for the expansion of the classification of topological phases of matter.},

  abstract = {Topological insulators and their intriguing edge states can be understood in a single-particle picture and can as such be exhaustively classified. Interactions significantly complicate this picture and can lead to entirely new insulating phases, with an altogether much richer and less explored phenomenology. Most saliently, lattice generalizations of fractional quantum Hall states, dubbed fractional Chern insulators, have recently been predicted to be stabilized by interactions within nearly dispersionless bands with nonzero Chern number, C. Contrary to their continuum analogues, these states do not require an external magnetic field and may potentially persist even at room temperature, which make these systems very attractive for possible applications such as topological quantum computation. This review recapitulates the basics of tight-binding models hosting nearly flat bands with nontrivial topology, C{$\neq$}0, and summarizes the present understanding of interactions and strongly correlated phases within these bands. Emphasis is made on microscopic models, highlighting the analogy with continuum Landau level physics, as well as qualitatively new, lattice specific, aspects including Berry curvature fluctuations, competing instabilities as well as novel collective states of matter emerging in bands with {\textbar}C{\textbar}{$>$}1. Possible experimental realizations, including oxide interfaces and cold atom implementations as well as generalizations to flat bands characterized by other topological invariants are also discussed.},

  abstract = {We theoretically study the topological properties of the tight-binding model on the breathing kagome lattice with antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling (SOC) between nearest neighbors. We show that the system hosts nontrivial topological phases even without second-nearest-neighbor hopping and that the weakly dispersing band of the kagome lattice can become topological. The main results are presented in the form of phase diagrams, where the {$\mathbb{Z}$}2 topological index is shown as a function of SOC (intrinsically allowed and Rashba) and lattice trimerization. In addition, exact diagonalization is compared with effective low-energy theories around the high-symmetry points. We find that the weakly dispersing band has a very robust topological property associated with it. Moreover, the Rashba SOC can produce a topological phase rather than hinder it, in contrast to the honeycomb lattice. Finally, we consider the case of a fully spin polarized (ferromagnetic) system, breaking time-reversal symmetry. We find a phase diagram that includes systems with finite Chern numbers. In this case too, the weakly dispersing band is topologically robust to trimerization.},

  abstract = {In the last years, kagome materials received massive attention by virtue of being candidate hosts for a large variety of quantum phases: spin liquids, unconventional superconductivity, and topological phases of matter, to name the more exotic. One of the most interesting features is tunability: changing the filling, the non-interacting band structure can be tuned from flat bands to conventional metallic phases as well as to semimetals. In this paper we concentrate on the latter. At specific lattice filling the electronic bands have a semimetallic structure, hosting Dirac, massless quasiparticles, like in graphene or other layered two dimensional materials. Specifically, we determine what terms can be added to the nearest neighbor hopping that open at gap at said Dirac point. These terms can in principle arise through external perturbations, interactions or collective instabilities. We classify the sixteen possible gap-opening terms according to the broken symmetries. Furthermore, we identify concrete microscopic realisations allowing for an interpretation of these phases.},

Furthermore, we topologically classify all three-band lattice models with the same crystalline symmetries as the breathing kagome lattice and show that though none of the phases have protected zero-energy corner states, some of the phases are obstructed atomic limits which exhibit a filling anomaly.},

  abstract = {The kagome lattice has garnered significant attention due to its ability to host quantum spin Fermi liquid states. Recently, the combination of unique lattice geometry, electron-electron correlations, and adjustable magnetism in solid kagome materials has led to the discovery of numerous fascinating quantum properties. These include unconventional superconductivity, charge and spin density waves (CDW/SDW), pair density waves (PDW), and Chern insulator phases. These emergent states are closely associated with the distinctive characteristics of the kagome lattice's electronic structure, such as van Hove singularities, Dirac fermions, and flat bands, which can exhibit exotic quasi-particle excitations under different symmetries and magnetic conditions. Recently, various quantum kagome materials have been developed, typically consisting of kagome layers stacked along the \$z\$-axis with atoms either filling the geometric centers of the kagome lattice or embedded between the layers. In this topical review, we begin by introducing the fundamental properties of several kagome materials. To gain an in-depth understanding of the relationship between topology and correlation, we then discuss the complex phenomena observed in these systems. These include the simplest kagome metal \$T\_3X\$, kagome intercalation metal \$TX\$, and the ternary compounds \$AT\_6X\_6\$ and \$RT\_3X\_5\$ (\$A\$ = Li, Mg, Ca, or rare earth; \$T\$ = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni; \$X\$ = Sn, Ge; \$R\$ = K, Rb, Cs). Finally, we provide a perspective on future experimental work in this field.},

Motivated by the recent experimental observation of corner states in acoustic and photonic structures, we theoretically study the dipolar-coupled gyration motion of magnetic solitons on the two-dimensional breathing kagome lattice. We calculate the phase diagram and predict both the Tamm--Shockley edge modes and the second-order corner states when the ratio between alternate lattice constants is greater than a critical value. We show that the emerging corner states are topologically robust against both structure defects and moderate disorders. Micromagnetic simulations are implemented to verify the theoretical predictions with an excellent agreement. Our results pave the way for investigating higher-order topological insulators based on magnetic solitons.},

  abstract = {A new class of materials that are insulating in the bulk and on surfaces but have conducting hinge channels is studied.           ,                             Three-dimensional topological (crystalline) insulators are materials with an insulating bulk but conducting surface states that are topologically protected by time-reversal (or spatial) symmetries. We extend the notion of three-dimensional topological insulators to systems that host no gapless surface states but exhibit topologically protected gapless hinge states. Their topological character is protected by spatiotemporal symmetries of which we present two cases: (i) Chiral higher-order topological insulators protected by the combination of time-reversal and a fourfold rotation symmetry. Their hinge states are chiral modes, and the bulk topology is                                                                                                                        Z                         2                                                                                                                                   -classified. (ii) Helical higher-order topological insulators protected by time-reversal and mirror symmetries. Their hinge states come in Kramers pairs, and the bulk topology is                                                                                               Z                                                                                                            -classified. We provide the topological invariants for both cases. Furthermore, we show that SnTe as well as surface-modified Bi               2               TeI, BiSe, and BiTe are helical higher-order topological insulators and propose a realistic experimental setup to detect the hinge states.},

  abstract = {Motivated by the growing interest in band structures featuring higher-order Van Hove singularities (HOVHS), we investigate a spinless fermion kagome system characterized by nearest-neighbor (NN) and next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping amplitudes. While NN hopping preserves time-reversal symmetry, NNN hopping, akin to chiral hopping on the Haldane lattice, breaks time-reversal symmetry and leads to the formation of topological bands with Chern numbers ranging from \$C = {\textbackslash}pm 1\$ to \$C = {\textbackslash}pm 4\$. We perform analytical and numerical analysis of the energy bands near the high-symmetry points \${\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{{\textbackslash}Gamma\}\$, \${\textbackslash}pm {\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{K\}\$, and \${\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{M\_i\}\$ (\$i=1,2,3\$), which uncover a rich and complex landscape of HOVHS, controlled by the magnitude and phase of the NNN hopping. We observe power-law divergences in the density of states (DOS), \${\textbackslash}rho({\textbackslash}epsilon) {\textbackslash}sim {\textbar}{\textbackslash}epsilon{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}\{-{\textbackslash}nu\}\$, with exponents \${\textbackslash}nu = 1/2, 1/3, 1/4\$, which can significantly affect the anomalous Hall response at low temperatures when the Fermi level crosses the HOVHS. Additionally, the NNN hopping induces the formation of higher Chern number bands \$C = {\textbackslash}pm 2, {\textbackslash}pm 4\$ in the middle of the spectrum obeying a sublattice interference whereupon electronic states are maximally localized in each of the sublattices when the momentum approaches the three high-symmetry points \${\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{M\_i\}\$ (\$i=1,2,3\$) on the Brillouin zone boundary. This classification of HOVHS in kagome systems provides a platform to explore unconventional electronic orders induced by electronic correlations.},

By tuning a single geometry parameter, the photonic corner and edge states emerge or disappear with higher-order topological transitions. Two distinct higher-order topological insulator phases and a normal insulator phase are revealed. Their topological indices are obtained from symmetry representations. A photonic analog of the fractional corner charge is introduced to distinguish the two higher-order topological insulator phases. Our predictions can be readily realized and verified in configurable dielectric photonic crystals.},

  abstract = {Topological band theory has achieved great success in the high-throughput search for topological band structures both in paramagnetic and magnetic crystal materials. However, a significant proportion of materials are topologically trivial insulators at the Fermi level. In this paper, we show that, remarkably, for a subset of the topologically trivial insulators, knowing only their electron number and the Wyckoff positions of the atoms we can separate them into two groups: the obstructed atomic insulator (OAI) and the atomic insulator (AI). The interesting group, the OAI, have a center of charge not localized on the atoms. Using the theory of topological quantum chemistry, in this work we first derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for a topologically trivial insulator to be a filling enforced obstructed atomic insulator (feOAI) in the 1651 Shubnikov space groups. Remarkably, the filling enforced criteria enable the identification of obstructed atomic bands without knowing the representations of the band structures. Hence, no  calculations are needed for the filling enforced criteria, although they are needed to obtain the band gaps. With the help of the Topological Quantum Chemistry website, we have performed a high-throughput search for feOAIs and have found that 957 ICSD entries (638 unique materials) are paramagnetic feOAIs, among which 738 (475) materials have an indirect gap. The metallic obstructed surface states of feOAIs are also showcased by several material examples.

Breathing kagome lattice is a prospective platform which can support higher-order topological corner states. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that higher-order topological corner states are supported in a breathing kagome lattice consisting of magnetically coupled resonant coils. The winding direction of each coil is determined to hold               C               3               symmetry for each triangle unit cell, enabling to emerge higher-order topological corner states. In addition, topological and trivial phases can be switched by changing the distances between the coils. The emergence of corner states in the topological phase is experimentally observed through admittance measurements. As an illustration, wireless power transfer is performed between the corner states, and between the bulk and corner states. The proposed configuration is a promising platform for not only investigating topological properties of the breathing kagome lattice but also an alternative mechanism of selective wireless power transfer.},
