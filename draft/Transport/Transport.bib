  abstract = {Recent advances in the manipulation of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) within the paradigm of orbitronics presents a promising avenue for the design of future electronic devices. In this context, the recently observed orbital Hall effect (OHE) occupies a special place. Here, focusing on both the second-order topological and quantum anomalous Hall insulators in two-dimensional ferromagnets, we demonstrate that topological phase transitions present an efficient and straightforward way to engineer the OHE, where the OAM distribution can be controlled by the nature of the band inversion. Using first-principles calculations, we identify Janus RuBrCl and three septuple layers of MnBi2Te4 as experimentally feasible examples of the proposed mechanism of OHE engineering by topology. With our work, we open up new possibilities for innovative applications in topological spintronics and orbitronics.},

  abstract = {We identify the quantum metric dipole as the geometric origin of the nonreciprocal directional dichroism which describes the change in the refractive index upon reversing the light propagation direction. Specifically, we find that the static limit of the nonreciprocal directional dichroism corresponds to a quadrupolar transport current from the quantum metric dipole, in response to a quadrupolar electric field. Moreover, at a finite frequency, we demonstrate that the steepest slope of the averaged quantum metric dipole gives rise to a peak in the differential refractive index between counterpropagating lights. Finally, we illustrate both features in a low-energy model.},

  abstract = {The quantum geometry has significant consequences in determining transport and optical properties in quantum materials. Here, we use a semiclassical formalism coupled with perturbative corrections unifying the nonlinear anomalous Hall effect (NLAHE) and nonreciprocal magnetoresistance (NMR, longitudinal resistance) from the quantum geometry. In the dc limit, both transverse and longitudinal nonlinear conductivities include a term due to the normalized quantum metric dipole. The quantum metric contribution is intrinsic and does not scale with the quasiparticle lifetime. We demonstrate the coexistence of a NLAHE and NMR in films of the doped antiferromagentic topological insulator MnBi\$\_2\$Te\$\_4\$. Our work indicates that both longitudinal and transverse nonlinear transport provide a sensitive probe of the quantum geometry in solids.},

  abstract = {It has been theoretically predicted that perturbation of the Berry curvature by electromagnetic fields gives rise to intrinsic nonlinear anomalous Hall effects that are independent of scattering. Two types of nonlinear anomalous Hall effects are expected. The electric nonlinear Hall effect has recently begun to receive attention, while very few studies are concerned with the magneto-nonlinear Hall effect. Here, we combine experiment and first-principles calculations to show that the kagome ferromagnet Fe3⁢Sn2 displays such a magneto-nonlinear Hall effect. By systematic field angular and temperature-dependent transport measurements, we unambiguously identify a large anomalous Hall current that is linear in both applied in-plane electric and magnetic fields, utilizing a unique in-plane configuration. We clarify its dominant orbital origin and connect it to the magneto-nonlinear Hall effect. The effect is governed by the intrinsic quantum geometric properties of Bloch electrons. Our results demonstrate the significance of the quantum geometry of electron wave functions from the orbital degree of freedom and open up a new direction in Hall transport effects.},

  abstract = {The Berry curvature and quantum metric are the imaginary part and real part, respectively, of the quantum geometric tensor, which characterizes the topology of quantum states1. The Berry curvature is known to generate a number of important transport phenomena, such as the quantum Hall effect and the anomalous Hall effect2,3; however, the consequences of the quantum metric have rarely been probed by transport measurements. Here we report the observation of quantum-metric-induced nonlinear transport, including both a nonlinear anomalous Hall effect and a diode-like non-reciprocal longitudinal response, in thin films of a topological antiferromagnet, MnBi2Te4. Our observations reveal that the transverse and longitudinal nonlinear conductivities reverse signs when reversing the antiferromagnetic order, diminish above the N{\'e}el temperature and are insensitive to disorder scattering, thus verifying their origin in the band-structure topology. They also flip signs between electron- and hole-doped regions, in agreement with theoretical calculations. Our work provides a means to probe the quantum metric through nonlinear transport and to design magnetic nonlinear devices.},

  abstract = {Rectified electric current induced by irradiating light, a so-called photocurrent, is an established phenomenon in optoelectronic physics. In this paper, we present a comprehensive classification of the photocurrent response arising from the parity violation in bulk systems. We clarify the contrasting role of {$T$} and {$P$}⁢{$T$} symmetries and consequently find new types of photocurrent phenomena characteristic of parity-violating magnets---the intrinsic Fermi surface effect and the gyration current. In particular, the gyration current is induced by circularly polarized light, and it is the counterpart of the shift current caused by linearly polarized light. This photocurrent adds a new functionality of materials studied in various fields of condensed matter physics such as multiferroics and spintronics. A list of materials is provided. Furthermore, we show that the gyration current is strongly enhanced by topologically nontrivial band dispersion. On the basis of the microscopic analysis of Dirac models, we demonstrate the divergent photocurrent response and elucidate the importance of the tilting of Dirac cones.},
