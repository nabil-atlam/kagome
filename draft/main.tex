\begin{abstract}

In this paper, we investigate the quantum metric-induced nonlinear transport phenomena on bilayer Kagome lattice systems in the non-interacting limit in the tight-binding approach.

\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \blue{Background on the kagome lattice and physics.} 
    \item \blue{Nonlinear transport phenomena coming from the quantum metric} 
    \item \textcolor{purple}{Focus of the research: } \blue{Nonlinear transport phenomena 
    based on the quantum metric that could arise in bilayer magnetic kagome systems}

    \item \textcolor{purple}{Research gap/ question}: \blue{In nature, there are families 
    of kagome materials with: 1) spin-orbit coupling 2) magnetism, including various 
    magnetic orderings. The goal now is to shed light on quantum metric transport 
    in these systems, and see if there is something new one can learn from it. }
